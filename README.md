# Deepfake Detector ‚Äî Xception + Grad‚ÄëCAM + Gradio

A compact, end‚Äëto‚Äëend deepfake image detector with **explanations**. The project fine‚Äëtunes **Xception** (via `timm`) on a real/fake image dataset, reports standard metrics, and serves **interpretable** predictions through a **Gradio** UI with **Grad‚ÄëCAM** heatmaps and optional **LLM‚Äëgenerated rationales** (via Groq API).

> Notebooks: `train.ipynb` (training + evaluation) and `explain.ipynb` (interactive inference + explanations).

## ‚ú® Features
- **Backbone**: `timm.create_model('xception', pretrained=True, num_classes=2)`  
- **Data pipeline**: `Resize(299√ó299)` ‚Üí `ToTensor()` ‚Üí `Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[...])`  
  + Training augments: `RandomHorizontalFlip`, `RandomRotation(¬±10¬∞)`
- **Training setup**: `Adam(lr=1e-4)` + `CrossEntropyLoss` + `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler  
  Batch size `32`, up to `30` epochs (early save on best validation loss)
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, + confusion matrices for **train** and **test**
- **Explainability**: `pytorch-grad-cam` (Grad‚ÄëCAM) heatmaps on predictions
- **UI**: Gradio app (`demo = gr.Interface(...)`, `demo.launch()`)
- **Optional LLM explanation**: natural‚Äëlanguage justification of the heatmap via **Groq** (`GROQ_API_KEY`)

üîí Ethics & Limitations <br>
This project is for research and educational purposes only. Deepfake detection can be dataset‚Äëbiased and may not generalize to all manipulations or domains (e.g., compression artifacts, unseen generators, video vs. still images). Do not use as the sole basis for moderation, legal, or employment decisions.
